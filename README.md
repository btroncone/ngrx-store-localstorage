# ngrx-store-localstorage
Simple syncing between ngrx store and local storage.

## Dependencies
`ngrx-store-localstorage` depends on [@ngrx/store](https://github.com/ngrx/store) and [Angular 2](https://github.com/angular/angular).

## Usage
```bash
npm install ngrx-store-localstorage --save
```
1. Import `compose` and `combineReducers` from `@ngrx/store` and `@ngrx/core/compose`.
2. Invoke the `localStorageSync` function after `combineReducers`, this receives a `LocalStorageConfig` object and assigns the property `keys` the slices of state you would like to keep synced with local storage.
3. Optionally specify in the `LocalStorageConfig` whether to rehydrate this state from local storage as `initialState` on application bootstrap with the `rehydrate` property.
4. Invoke composed function with application reducers as an argument to `StoreModule.provideStore`.
```ts
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { StoreModule, ActionReducerMap, ActionReducer } from '@ngrx/store';
import { compose } from '@ngrx/core/compose';
import { localStorageSync } from 'ngrx-store-localstorage';
import { todos, visibilityFilter } from './reducers';


const reducers: ActionReducerMap<IState> = {todos, visibilityFilter};

export function localStorageSyncReducer(reducer: ActionReducer<any>): ActionReducer<any> {
  return localStorageSync({keys: ['todos']})(reducer);
}
const metaReducers: Array<ActionReducer<any, any>> = [localStorageSyncReducer];

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    StoreModule.forRoot(
        reducers,
        {metaReducers}
    )
  ]
})
export class MyAppModule {}
```

## API
### `localStorageSync(config: LocalStorageConfig): Reducer`
Provide state (reducer) keys to sync with local storage. *Returns a meta-reducer*.

#### Arguments
* `config` An object that matches with the `LocalStorageConfig` interface, `keys` is the only required property.

### **LocalStorageConfig**
An interface defining the configuration attributes to bootstrap `localStorageSync`. The following are properties which compose `LocalStorageConfig`:
* `keys` (required) State keys to sync with local storage. The keys can be defined in two different formats:
    * `string[]`: Array of strings representing the state (reducer) keys. Full state will be synced (e.g. `localStorageSync({keys: ['todos']})`).

    * `object[]`: Array of objects where for each object the key represents the state key and the value represents custom serialize/deserialize options. This can be one of the following:

        * An array of properties which should be synced. This allows for the partial state sync (e.g. `localStorageSync({keys: [{todos: ['name', 'status'] }, ... ]})`).

        * A reviver function as specified in the [JSON.parse documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse).

        * An object with properties that specify one or more of the following:

            * serialize: A function that takes a state object and returns a plain json object to pass to json.stringify.

            * deserialize: A function that takes that takes the raw JSON from JSON.parse and builds a state object.

            * replacer: A replacer function as specified in the [JSON.stringify documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify).

            * space: The space value to pass JSON.stringify.

            * reviver: A reviver function as specified in the [JSON.parse documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse).

            * filter: An array of properties which should be synced (same format as the stand-along array specified above).

* `rehydrate` (optional) `boolean`: Pull initial state from local storage on startup, this will default to `false`.
* `storage` (optional) `Storage`: Specify an object that conforms to the Storage interface to use, this will default to `localStorage`.
* `removeOnUndefined` (optional) `boolean`: Specify if the state is removed from the storage when the new value is undefined, this will default to `false`.
* `storageKeySerializer` (optional) `(key: string) => string`: Ð¡ustom serialize function for storage keys, used to avoid Storage conflicts. 
Usage: `localStorageSync({keys: ['todos', 'visibilityFilter'], storageKeySerializer: (key) => 'cool_' + key, ... })`. In this example `Storage` will use keys `cool_todos` and `cool_visibilityFilter` keys to store `todos` and `visibilityFilter` slices of state). The key itself is used by default - `(key) => key`.

---
### ~~`localStorageSyncAndClean(keys: any[], rehydrate: boolean = false, removeOnUndefined: boolean = false): Reducer`~~
**This function is deprecated and soon will be removed, please use _localStorageSync(LocalStorageConfig)_.**

A shorthand that wraps the functionalities of `localStorageSync` and asumes `localStorage` as the storage.

#### Arguments

* `keys` State keys to sync with local storage. The keys can be defined in two different formats:
    * \(*string[]*): Array of strings representing the state (reducer) keys. Full state will be synced (e.g. `localStorageSync(['todos'])`).

    * \(*object[]*): Array of objects where for each object the key represents the state key and the value represents custom serialize/deserialize options. This can be one of the following:

        * An array of properties which should be synced. This allows for the partial state sync (e.g. `localStorageSync([{todos: ['name', 'status'] }, ... ])`).

        * A reviver function as specified in the [JSON.parse documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse).

        * An object with properties that specify one or more of the following:

            * serialize: A function that takes a state object and returns a plain json object to pass to json.stringify.

            * deserialize: A function that takes that takes the raw JSON from JSON.parse and builds a state object.

            * replacer: A replacer function as specified in the [JSON.stringify documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify).

            * space: The space value to pass JSON.stringify.

            * reviver: A reviver function as specified in the [JSON.parse documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse).

            * filter: An array of properties which should be synced (same format as the stand-along array specified above).
* `rehydrateState` \(*boolean? = false*): Pull initial state from local storage on startup.
* `removeOnUndefined` \(*boolean? = false*): Specify if the state is removed from the storage when the new value is undefined.
